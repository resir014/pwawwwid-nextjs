Hey there!

This website was created by [@resir014](https://github.com/resir014) as part of the [#WWWIDChallenge](https://medium.com/wwwid/tantangan-web-developer-untuk-membuat-aplikasi-web-bisa-digunakan-kurang-dari-5-detik-70bb7431741d) for February 2018.

The challenge was to create a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can load in less than 5 seconds. I was free to choose any framework/library as long as it's usable via all modern browsers. The website consists of a homepage with latest feeds, an article view, and category filters.

## Developing

A nodejs >= 6.0.0 setup with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is recommended.

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# ...or if you prefer npm
npm install

# start a development server at localhost:3000
yarn dev

# build for production
yarn build

# start server in production mode
yarn start
```

## Credits

Built with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) - the framework for server-rendered [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) apps.
